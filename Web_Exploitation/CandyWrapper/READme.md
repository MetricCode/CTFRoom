After looking at the about page, its being loaded by php. I tried a bunch of filters but it didnt work.
Since there was a .gitignore file, we can take a look at it.

There's one directory and we can do some fuzzing.
We can also try visiting the creds file.
Since it's php, we can't see its contents. I then tried the php filters on this file and got one that worked. The base64 filter.

And we've found some credentials.

After doing the fuzzing, I found a login page ```admin_area.php```
I entered the creds and got the first flag.

### Flag 2
If we check the cookies in the web-server, we find 2.

One for session handling and a ```superadmin``` cookie.

The cookie seemed to be base64 so after decoding it, it was set to ```false```

Encoding to ```true``` base64

with that, I set it to true and we get a command execute panel.

It seems that we can execute commands in a system so we can read the files on the server internally.

Seeing that there is a neymar user and that the web-server is running as him, we can try and check his home files and there we get a flag.

We finally get the flag.

And Done!
