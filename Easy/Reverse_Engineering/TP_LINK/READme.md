To start of the challenge, lets download the bin file that were given...
<br>
After running the ** _file_** command on the file after unzipping, we can see that the bin file is further compressed..
<br>
On running the __**binwalk**__ command on the file, we can see that it's indeed compressed..
<br>
Well, we can decompress this bin file using binwalk...
